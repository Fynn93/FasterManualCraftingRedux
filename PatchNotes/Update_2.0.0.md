Update 6 support. New "Crafting Speedometer" UI in workbenches. This update brought to you by Robb#6731




## New Stuff

- New "Crafting Speedometer" shows the exact speed multiplier you're currently at
  - ![Speedometer](https://i.imgur.com/YS2WQSv.png)
- Config option **Max VFX Sparks:** Controls how many of the "spark particles" the game is allowed to display, which can cause lag. This was previously fixed at 100 in the source code.

## Notes

Turtlefight (original mod author) has not been responding to contact attempts, so I (Robb) decided to upload this in the mean time. Since this is a separate mod from the original, you'll have to set your config options again.
